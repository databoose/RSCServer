FIXED CRITICAL BUGS: 

     PROBLEM :
         Client only seems to get send() from server if socket closes
        
         RESOLUTION : 
             Never added a newline to my outgoing buffer to the client, so the client never knew when the line stopped, so it hung forever until socket closure
      
     PROBLEM : 
         Timer thread constantly incrementing block.times_ran after a connection and a ban
        
         RESOLUTION : 
              When it was supposed to be scanning the signal'd IP addresses, it was accessing the banned IP list because of an out of bounds memory bug.

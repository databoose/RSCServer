WATCH OUT FOR :
            -  accessing arrays out of bound
            -  using strncpy with same exact buffer size of destination string, may cut off null teminator
            -  using only 1 as buffer length for "" when emptying a string
            -  improper breaks in nested if statements and or loops

            - always add a newline to the end of whatever you send to the client, otherwise the client will be infinitely waiting until socket close, safesend() should prevent this but keep an eye out for this issue.
            
            - make sure to keep all of the memory inside mysql.c local
